This project integrates two Spring Boot applications:
- **Product Management System**: Manages products with full CRUD operations.
- **Voucher System**: Provides discount codes that can be applied to products via REST API.

The integration between the two services is handled using Spring's `RestTemplate`, specifically with the `getForObject()` method to fetch voucher details from the Voucher Service and apply them to products.

The systems communicate through RESTful APIs, allowing vouchers to be applied directly to product prices.
